        I chose links that made the most sense to me. 
        The first links I will cover are the coffee beans, for these I picked three different coffee shops in the Salt Lake City area. 
        The connection between the image and coffee shops made a lot of sense to me. 
        I also felt that the circle links would connect well to the shape of the coffee beans.

        The next items I will cover is the written words. The rect shape worked well with written text and the shape.
        The words also related well with some of the links that I had picked. I chose a higher quality from a website I like to buy high quality coffee from. 
        Coffee Beans links to the wiki page for coffee beans. 
        With Matters linking to a YouTube video on how coffee is harvested.

        I chose the odder shapes for poly the shapes I picked was the sack of coffee, the cup and the spoon.
        The spoons links to Amazon page that sells coffee spoons. The cup links to Etsy page that sells stoneware coffee cups which is what I personally use. 
        The last link is the coffee beans this links to my favorite coffee. 
        I do not purchase this one as the price is way over what I am willing to pay but there is a local company that
